## Design
### Inspiration
I took inspiration from company Institue VZ from Slovenia https://www.institut-vz.si/</p>
### Wireframe
The idea for the page was to create onepager. When user click on any of the menu item, user is scroll down to this page. The last wireframe just show how it will look like when user will scroll on the bottom of the page. Note that end design got changed a bit - map is moved above contact form because of visual reasons - looks nicer.
### Color palette
Colour palette is taken from the company current visual identity.
### Typography
Typography is taken from the company currenty typography. Used for headings and parahraphs - font Ubunto</p>

## Testing
### Validator testing
HTML - no errors were retured when passing through the official W3C validator.
CSS - no errors were retured when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator.
Accessibility - I confirm that the colours and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools. *NOTE - footer colour I needed to take a shade darker gray from the colour pallete because of accessibility reasons.
